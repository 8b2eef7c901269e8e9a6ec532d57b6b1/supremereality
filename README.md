# SupremeReality

An imageboard written using Clojure, Javascript, Bulma.css and PostgreSQL.

## Usage

Supreme Reality uses http-kit as it's web server, which doesn't include (good) support for SSL/TLS/HTTPS. You need to use a reverse proxy such as Nginx or cloud/VPS based load balancer with SSL termination if available. Don't forget to enable x_forwarded_for on nginx or the load balancer so you can see their IP address.

Install Postgres with the database info at the top of the 'database.clj' file, at the comment 'Database connection info'. Feel free to change the password and/or schema names to whatever you want to set up.

After that navigate to your website's url/setup (ex: https://yoursite.com/setup). Don't try to navigate to any other page until you complete setup, otherwise the program will throw a database exception.

After you installed postgres, the reverseproxy/LB, enabled SSL, and then gone thru the setup page, all of the necessary tables should have been created and you're good to go!

The software will automatically create one board/topic, a 'meta' topic which has the same mod passwords as your site admin password.

happy posting - Jared
