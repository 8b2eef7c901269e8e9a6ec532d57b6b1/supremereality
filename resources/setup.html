        <p>If you're seeing this message, you have the app jar running on the server!</p>
        <p>However, before we get started, there are a few things you need to check:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>PostgreSQL</li>
          <li><ul>
              <li>Did you install postgres?</li>
              <li>Did you create a schema with the correct name?</li>
              <li>Did you set up the password in the environmental variable?</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Nginx</li>
          <li><ul>
              <li>Did you install Nginx?</li>
              <li>Did you configure it as a reverse proxy?</li>
              <li>Did you get an encryption cert from letsencrypt?</li>
              <li>Did you set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect in Nginx config?</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you didn't set up nginx yet, thats ok but do it after this. Supreme Reality expects a reverse proxy of some sort, and IP Bans will not work without that. Also, it's [current year] and there is no excuse for not using encryption.</p>
      <p>If you have no idea what I'm talking about, go back and read the documentation (README.md)</p>
      <p>If you at least have postgres set up and working, press 'next' to proceed</p>
          <p class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-bold">If you get the white screen of death, or a 500 error, or any other error screen at this step, it means you didn't set up postgres right. You may have to restart the app, fix postgres and try again.</p>
