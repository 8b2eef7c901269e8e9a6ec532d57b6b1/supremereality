                  <p>{{sitename}} is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard" target="_blank">imageboard</a>, a type of Internet forum 
                    that revolves around the posting of images, often alongside related text and discussion. Unlike traditional forums 
                  and social media, imageboards do not require user registration, and users are anonymous by default.</p>

                  <h3 class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-info">How do I use {{sitename}}?</h3>
                  <p>To get started, simply click the 'Topics' button in the top left corner and browse the available topics of discussion. If the website owner 
                    has allowed it, users can create their own topics as well using the 'Create Topic' button. Topics marked "SFW", or safe-for-work, are intended 
                    to not allow adult content. Conversely, topics marked "NSFW", or not-safe-for-work, may contain material that is, well... not safe to browse at work. 
                    Or school. Or at all, if you're under the age of 18.

                    <h3 class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-info">What is that green number next to the topic metrics?</h3>
                    <p>If you notice, on the right side of every topic link under topics, there are some numbers to show how many users, posts, and threads 
                      each topic contains at the given moment. There is also a number, colored light green, which is that topic's 'Quality Score'. A topic's 
                      quality is algorithmically determined based on the active (non locked) posts in that topic at the current moment. Higher scores 
                      are assigned to posts of longer length, and with higher than average word length. A topic's overall quality score is the average score 
                      of all posts in that topic. Number of users is not a factor that is considered. Quality score is also used to determine the order in which 
                      threads are displayed in each topic, with higher scores at the front of the index/catalog, and lower ones further down.

                    <h3 class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-info">How do I use spoilers and other formatting marks?</h3>
                    <p>You can include formatting marks in your posts in order to change how they look. In order to create a spoiler effect, you use the 
                      spoiler tag <span class="has-text-weight-bold">[spoiler]spoilered text[/spoiler] or **spoilered text**</span>. example -> <span class="spoiler">spoilered text</span>. 
                      Other tags you can include in square brackets to format the text are <span class="has-text-weight-bold">[red]red text[/red] or ==red text==</span> for <span class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-bold">red text</span> 
                      and <span class="has-text-weight-bold">[quote]green text quoting[/quote]</span> for <div class="padd3 has-text-success has-text-weight-bold has-background-grey-dark">green text quoting</div> 
                      <br>You can also use <span class="has-text-weight-bold">>>>/topic/</span> for links to topics.
                      <br><br>In order to keep everyone's posts nice and neat, if you use a formatting mark without closing it, your post may not display correctly.
